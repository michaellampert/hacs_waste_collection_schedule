      args:

        street: "Marienhöhe"

## How to get the source arguments

These values are the location you want to query for. Make sure, the writing is exactly as it is on [https://www.awn-online.de/abfuhrtermine](https://www.awn-online.de/abfuhrtermine). Typos will result in an parsing error which is printed in the log. As `house_number` expects a numeric input, address suffixes have to be provided via the `address_suffix` argument.
`address_suffix` could be for example a alpha-numeric character "A" or a additional house number like "/1".
