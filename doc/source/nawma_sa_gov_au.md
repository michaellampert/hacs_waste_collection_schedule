```

### Configuration Variables

```

## How to get the source arguments

Visit the [North Adelaide Waste Management Authority collection days](https://www.nawma.sa.gov.au/kerbside-collections/bin-collection-days/) page and search for your address.  The arguments should exactly match the results shown for Suburb and Street and (if required) the number portion of the auto-completed address.

Note: Some addresses can be quite obscure, for example for the Gawler main street set `street_name` to `'Murray Street (sec between Ayers and the railway line'`.
